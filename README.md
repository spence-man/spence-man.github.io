## Synopsis

This is a project that was created to test out a personal profile website using GitHub Pages. This is hosted directly from this GitHub repository. The process involved using two different templates(boilerplate and HTML5) and customizing them to my needs. As per the template, jQuery was used for the scrolling effect and SASS for the styling. 

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This project exists for educational purposes to test out using different type of hosting and template to create a stylish and fully responsive website.
